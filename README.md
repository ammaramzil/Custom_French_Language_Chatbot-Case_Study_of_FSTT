      This project creates a smart chatbot for the Faculty of Sciences and Techniques of Tangier (FSTT) using two main techniques. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), along with LangChain and Vector Databases, helps the chatbot find the right information from a large dataset to give accurate answers. Separately, the chatbot is fine-tuned on French data (related to FSTT) to improve how it understands and responds in that specific context. Users can choose which technique to use through the interface named <strong>HERCULES</strong>, providing an interactive solution for asking questions about FSTT and receiving accurate answers using various natural language processing technologies.

## Data Source
We gathered data from the official website of the Faculty of Sciences and Techniques of Tangier ([FSTT](https://fstt.ac.ma/Portail2023/)). The extracted data includes:

- Overview of the faculty
- Academic offerings
- Departments
- Committees
- Faculty members
- Student clubs
- And more

For this task, we utilized the **BeautifulSoup** library to scrape and collect the necessary information.

## Data Processing Workflow
1. **Data Splitting**:  
   The collected data was broken down into smaller, manageable chunks using the `langchain-text-splitters` library. This step is vital for improving data management and optimizing both the retrieval and text generation processes.

2. **Text Embeddings**:  
   We transformed these text chunks into vector representations by utilizing embedding models such as `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` from Hugging Face and `nomic-embed-text` from Mistral. These embeddings convert text into formats that language models can efficiently process.

3. **Vector Storage**:  
   The resulting vectors were stored in specialized vector databases like ChromaDB or FAISS. These databases are optimized for fast, efficient vector searches, a key component for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

4. **Language Models**:  
   We utilized several large language models (LLMs), including:
   - Mistral
   - Llama2
   - Llama3
   - Gemma

   These models were chosen for their strong performance in understanding and generating French text with high precision.

5. **Prompt Engineering**:  
   To enhance the responses generated by the LLMs, we employed various prompt engineering techniques. This involved crafting precise questions, offering additional context, and using custom prompt templates to guide the models towards more accurate and relevant answers.

## Web Application Development
We built a web application using **Streamlit**, **Flask**, and **MongoDB** that enables users to:
   - Submit queries related to FSTT
   - Select their preferred language model (LLM)
   - Save conversations for future reference
   - Access and review saved conversations at any time

The app provides a simple, user-friendly interface that makes interacting with the chatbot and retrieving FSTT-related information straightforward and efficient.

## Limitations and Challenges
1. **Execution Time**:  
   Leveraging a GPU drastically reduced the processing time, cutting it down from 17 minutes on a CPU to just 2-4 minutes on a GPU.

2. **Hallucination Issues**:  
   Some responses were inaccurate or nonsensical due to hallucinations, which were influenced by factors such as data quality, query length, and query complexity.

3. **Hardware Limitations**:  
   Limited hardware resources, especially RAM, made it challenging to manage large datasets and run complex models efficiently, impacting overall performance.

4. **Data Availability**:  
   The chatbotâ€™s performance was hindered by the limited amount of high-quality, specific data related to FSTT. Collecting more detailed data would improve its accuracy and comprehensiveness.
