      This project creates a smart chatbot for the Faculty of Sciences and Techniques of Tangier (FSTT) using two main techniques. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), along with LangChain and Vector Databases, helps the chatbot find the right information from a large dataset to give accurate answers. Separately, the chatbot is fine-tuned on French data (related to FSTT) to improve how it understands and responds in that specific context. Users can choose which technique to use through the interface named <strong>HERCULES</strong>, providing an interactive solution for asking questions about FSTT and receiving accurate answers using various natural language processing technologies.
